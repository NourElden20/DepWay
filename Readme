# 🚀 DepWay – Automating Dockerization for Developers

## 📖 Overview
**DepWay** is a web-based platform that automates the **Dockerization process** for developers and students.  
Instead of manually writing Dockerfiles and building Docker images, users can upload their project or connect a GitHub repository.  
DepWay will automatically generate a Dockerfile, build the image, and run it locally or in a controlled environment — making **containerization** simple, fast, and educational.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate the creation of Dockerfiles for different backend technologies (Node.js, Python, .NET, etc.).
- Build and run Docker images directly from a user-friendly web interface.
- Provide an educational tool to teach DevOps fundamentals.
- Simplify environment setup and packaging for student and small developer projects.

---

## ⚙️ Features
### 👤 User Management
- Register/Login to manage Dockerized projects.  

### 📦 Project Upload / GitHub Integration
- Upload project files or link a GitHub repository.
- Automatically detect the backend language or framework.

### 🐳 Automatic Dockerfile Generation
- Generate Dockerfile templates dynamically based on the detected technology.
- Allow users to preview or edit before building.

### ⚙️ Image Building and Containerization
- Automatically build Docker images.
- Show real-time build logs and status feedback.

### ▶️ Container Execution
- Run containers in a sandboxed local environment.
- Display container ID, exposed port, and runtime status.

### 🧾 Logs & History
- Keep a record of all builds and execution logs for each project.

## 🧱 System Architecture
1. **Frontend:** Web dashboard for project management (Next.js).  
2. **Backend API:** Handles project uploads, Dockerfile generation, and build logic (Node.js).  
3. **Docker Engine:** Runs containers using Docker SDK or CLI.  
4. **Database:** Stores user, project, and build history data (PostgreSQL).
